                                            Project 3: Customer Segmentation
                                            
Objective: Segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior, demographic information, or any other relevant features to help with targeted marketing. Techniques Used: Clustering: Used K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers. Dimensionality Reduction: If applicable, mention the use of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space.

Key Findings: Segmentation Insights: Describe the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high spenders, loyal customers, price-sensitive groups). Visualization: Include any visualizations (scatter plots, cluster centroids, or bar charts) to showcase the clusters.
